If your `/etc/docker` directory is empty, it likely means that a custom `daemon.json` file hasn't been created yet. Docker will operate with its default settings until you define specific configurations.

Here’s how you can create and configure the `daemon.json` file to specify a new location for Docker's data directory:

1. **Create the `daemon.json` File**:
   - Open a terminal and use a text editor to create the `daemon.json` file in the `/etc/docker` directory:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
     ```

2. **Configure the Data Directory**:
   - In the opened text editor, enter the following configuration, substituting `/new/path/to/docker-data` with the path where you want Docker to store its data:
     ```json
     {
       "data-root": "/new/path/to/docker-data"
     }
     ```
   - Save and close the file.

3. **Set Appropriate Permissions**:
   - Ensure the file has the correct permissions:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod 644 /etc/docker/daemon.json
     ```

4. **Restart the Docker Service**:
   - Restart Docker to apply the new configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```

5. **Verify the Configuration**:
   - Check that Docker is using the new data directory:
     ```bash
     docker info | grep "Docker Root Dir"
     ```

By doing this, you’re instructing Docker to use the specified path as its root directory for runtime data, including images, containers, and volumes. This is useful for managing storage on systems where the default directory may not have enough space or when you want to separate Docker data from other system data for management or security reasons.
