To create a new ZFS volume specifically for Docker data storage at the path `/tank0/docker_data`, you can follow these steps. Note that this assumes you already have ZFS installed and configured on your system:

1. **Create the ZFS Pool (if necessary)**:
   - First, ensure that you have a ZFS pool created. If you don't yet have a pool, you can create one using one or more disks. Here's how you might create a new pool named `tank0`:
     ```bash
     sudo zpool create tank0 /dev/sdx
     ```
   - Replace `/dev/sdx` with your actual block device identifier.

2. **Create the ZFS Volume**:
   - Once you have your ZFS pool, you can create a new file system specifically for Docker:
     ```bash
     sudo zfs create tank0/docker_data
     ```

3. **Set the Mount Point**:
   - By default, ZFS creates a mount point under `/` with the same name as the ZFS dataset. If it doesnâ€™t automatically mount to the desired path, or you want to ensure it does, you can set it explicitly:
     ```bash
     sudo zfs set mountpoint=/tank0/docker_data tank0/docker_data
     ```

4. **Adjust Permissions**:
   - Adjust the permissions of the mount point so that Docker can access and write to this directory:
     ```bash
     sudo chown root:root /tank0/docker_data
     sudo chmod 700 /tank0/docker_data
     ```

5. **Configure Docker to Use the New Volume**:
   - Configure Docker to use this new directory by editing or creating the `daemon.json` file in `/etc/docker/`:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
     ```
   - Add or modify the `data-root` setting:
     ```json
     {
       "data-root": "/tank0/docker_data"
     }
     ```
   - Save the file and exit the editor.

6. **Restart Docker**:
   - Restart Docker to apply these changes:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```

7. **Verify the Setup**:
   - Ensure that Docker is now using the new data directory:
     ```bash
     docker info | grep "Docker Root Dir"
     ```

This setup directs Docker to use the ZFS filesystem you created, leveraging ZFS's benefits for data management and protection. Remember that handling disks and filesystems can lead to data loss if not done carefully, so ensure backups are made before manipulating disk partitions or filesystems.
